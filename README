% [WIP] Sample transformation for CAAA message
% Aleksy Grabowski <hurufu@gmail.com>

> Current XML style sheet is work-in-progress, so a lot of features may be
> unavailable.

The main purpose is to help with understanding with ISO 20022 message for
non-programmers, but it may be helpful also for programmers alike, because of
increased readability and in-place documentation.

In order to test this style sheet just open sample.xml in any browser that
supports XSLT.
